The inclusion of the swastika, a symbol of hate and genocide, is also a form of visual sarcasm, as it is juxtaposed with the innocent-looking cat and mouse, which are typically associated with children's entertainment. The book's title, \"MAUS,\" is a play on words, as it is a reference to the character Maus from the comic, but also sounds like \"mouse,\" which is a term often used to describe someone who is clever or cunning. The overall design of the cover is meant to be ironic and satirical, commenting on the absurdity of censorship and the complexities of language and imagery in art.\n```",
