        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The user's comment is sarcastic because it implies that the original post is not good, despite the author's claim that it is. The use of \"actually\" to emphasize the rarity of a good post and the phrase \"ttt post\" (which is likely an abbreviation for \"try-hard troll post\") further reinforce the sarcastic tone."

        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The tweet is not sarcastic because it is making a genuine comment about the popularity of dark mode, rather than saying the opposite of what is meant. The use of humor and wordplay is intended to be lighthearted and playful, rather than ironic or mocking."

The use of the QR code and the URL adds to the playful tone of the image. Overall, the image is likely intended to be humorous and lighthearted, rather than a serious technical reference."

        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The tweet's tone and language suggest that the user is being sarcastic. The use of hyperbole (\"it's terrible for the environment\") and the implication that natural skeletons are a viable alternative to plastic ones are clear indicators of sarcasm. Additionally, the inclusion of the \"/s\" at the end of the tweet further reinforces the sarcastic tone."
