        "llama-mm-label": "1",
        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The cat's expression and posture suggest that it is not happy about the maintenance request, and the caption \"cat not letting maintenance do their job\" implies that the cat is intentionally blocking the maintenance worker's path. The use of the word \"not\" instead of \"letting\" is a common grammatical error in informal writing, which adds to the sarcastic tone of the caption. Overall, the image and caption together convey a sense of frustration and annoyance, which is a hallmark of sarcasm."

        "llama-mm-label": "0",
        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The caption's use of colloquial language and exclamation marks (\"oh man\", \"lol\") indicates a casual and humorous tone, rather than one of genuine frustration. Additionally, the image itself shows a cat that appears relaxed and content, which further supports the idea that the caption is intended to be humorous rather than sarcastic. Overall, the combination of language and visual cues suggests that the caption is meant to be a lighthearted and playful observation, rather than a sarcastic comment."

        "llama-mm-label": "1",
        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The caption is likely sarcastic because it implies that the cat's behavior is predictable and routine, and that the cat is intentionally knocking over the Christmas tree as part of a ritual. The use of the word \"ritual\" also suggests a sense of irony and playfulness, which is consistent with sarcastic language."

        "llama-mm-label": "0",
        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The text is not sarcastic because it is a straightforward statement of ownership and possession. The use of the phrase \"fuck you\" is an idiomatic expression used to emphasize the dog's claim, rather than a genuine expression of anger or hostility. The image of the dog lying on the bed also supports the idea that the dog is claiming the bed as its own, and the text is simply a statement of that claim."
