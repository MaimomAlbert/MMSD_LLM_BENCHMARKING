The use of the phrase \"I used to own Darth Vader\" is an exaggeration, implying that the speaker had control over the powerful character, which is an absurd notion. The inclusion of Watto, a character who was a pawn in the trade federation, adds to the comedic effect by making him seem insignificant in comparison to Darth Vader.
