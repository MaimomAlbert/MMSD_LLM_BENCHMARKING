However, in this case, the phrase is being used to describe the sound of the jets' engines, which are known for their loud and distinctive noise. The use of the word \"joke\" in this context creates a clever and amusing pun, making the caption humorous. The image itself is a straightforward depiction of two large airplanes, with no apparent connection to the caption. The caption is the only element that adds humor to the image, making it a lighthearted and playful joke. Overall, the combination of the caption and the image creates a humorous effect, making the meme NOT SARCASTIC.",

        "llama-mm-reasoning": "The image is a still from the TV show \"The Mindy Project,\" featuring actor Chris Messina as Dr. Danny Castellano. The text at the top reads, \"When a parent tells me that their kid is an angel.\" Below this, a caption in white text on the image says, \"[Whispering] So was Lucifer.\" This caption is a quote from the show, where Dr. Castellano makes a humorous comment about the devil being an angel at one point in history. The humor in the caption comes from the unexpected twist on the common phrase \"angel,\" which is typically associated with innocence and goodness. By saying \"so was Lucifer,\" Dr. Castellano is poking fun at the idea that anyone can be considered an angel, even someone as mischievous as the devil. The use of the word \"whispering\" adds to the comedic effect, implying that Dr. Castellano is sharing a secret or making a joke that only the person he's talking to will understand. Overall, the caption is a lighthearted and playful take on the idea of what it means to be an angel, and it adds to the humor of the scene in the TV show.",
