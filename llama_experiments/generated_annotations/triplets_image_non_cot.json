The text \"Your meme with 2000 upvotes but losing momentum at 11 pm\" is superimposed over the characters, while the text \"Europe waking up and checking Reddit\" is placed below an image of fighter jets flying in the sky. The meme is humorous because it exaggerates the idea that a popular online post can suddenly lose its momentum and become less relevant as new content is shared on social media platforms like Reddit. The use of a dramatic scene from Star Wars adds to the comedic effect, implying that the post's popularity is being threatened by external forces beyond the creator's control. Overall, the meme pokes fun at the fleeting nature of online fame and the challenges of maintaining a post's popularity over time.",

The use of a green monster as a representation of a garbage collector adds to the comedic effect, implying that even fantastical creatures can be associated with menial jobs.

The use of the phrase \"40 points to Gryffindor\" is a reference to the points system used in the Harry Potter series, where students earn points for their house (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff) for good behavior and achievements. In this case, the phrase is being used to imply that even though Harry has made mistakes and caused problems, he has still managed to earn a significant number of points for Gryffindor, which is a testament to his bravery and determination.

In this meme, the punchline \"PUSSY\" is a play on words, referencing Anakin's fear of loss rather than his fear of death. The use of Mr. Krabs, a character known for his greed and love of money, adds to the comedic effect, as it implies that Anakin's decision to leave the Jedi order was motivated by a desire for wealth and material possessions.
